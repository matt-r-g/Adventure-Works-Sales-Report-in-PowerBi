# 📊 Power BI Sales Report: AdventureWorks Dataset 🖥️

Welcome to the repository! In this project, I created an **interactive sales report** using **Power BI** and the **AdventureWorks dataset**. The report provides dynamic visualisations to explore sales performance, customer data and product information, and was developed in a **virtual machine** to ensure a consistent and isolated environment.

## 📝 Project Overview

The project focuses on creating an **interactive Power BI report** that allows users to explore various dimensions of the sales data from the **AdventureWorks dataset**. This includes analysing sales trends, product performance, regional sales and customer demographics. The visualisations are designed to be interactive, providing users with a rich and engaging experience for deeper insights.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Visualisations**: Users can filter, drill down, and hover over charts to explore the data in detail.
- **Dynamic Reports**: The report updates in real-time as users apply filters or interact with the charts.
- **Data Exploration**: Includes detailed breakdowns by product, region, sales person and customer.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI**: Used for building interactive reports and dashboards.
- **AdventureWorks Dataset**: A sample dataset containing information about a fictional company's sales, products, customers, and more.
- **Virtual Machine**: The development environment used to build and test the report, ensuring consistency across different systems.

## 📈 Visualisations in the Report

The Power BI report includes several interactive visualisations, such as:

- **Sales Performance by Region**: Line charts and bar graphs showing total sales, profits, and trends.
